# HTML AND CSS

## Learning Competencies

* Use [Semantic HTML](http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3/5-site-structure/2-semantic-markup.html) to structure a website
* Use CSS selectors to efficiently select any DOM element #p2
* Explain the tradeoffs of different CSS selectors and CSS specificity and design your CSS to optimize these
* Change basic CSS appearance: colors, widths, padding, margin
* Position elements using CSS positioning, display and float

## Summary 
HTML is used to create the general structure of a page.  CSS is used to add styles to this page.  In this challenge you will use HTML and CSS to recreate an existing web site. 

## Releases
Work through each release completely before moving on.  When you finish a release, make sure you UNDERSTAND the code. 

###Release 0: Choose your poison
Find a web page that represents a topic / item you are interested in (like bicycles).  The page should be relatively simple but have some images and some text.  

* Take a screenshot of the website.  You will use this screenshot for your recreation (you should NOT look at the html or styles from the original site - base all your work off the screenshot.)  Add this screenshot to your source forder

* Create an `image` directory and download a subset of the images from the page to this folder. (Your page does not need to have exact images - if there are a lot of similar images you can use one to represent them all).  

### Release 1 : The HTML
Create the HTML using HTML 5.  
*  Create the `<head>` tag with links to a `normalize.css` and your style sheet `styles.css`.
* Create the `<body>` with a `<header>`, `<nav>` and content. 
* You can duplicate the text of your site exactly, or if there is a lot of text you can use [lorem ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) text. 
* Add all the images.
* Make sure your page is [validated](http://validator.w3.org/).

Your HTML should contain as little formatting as possible.

### Release 2 : Add the CSS

Your CSS should recreate the format of your original page. Use a color picker to get the correct colors. 

## Optimize your learning
Make sure you are **learning CSS** not just getting caught in the **try and see** cycle.

* Can you explain how you created each effect? 
* Can you explain why you made choices of particular css properties (like display, float, positioning)?  
* Is your CSS well factored for change? If the main navigation were to move from the top to the left side, how hard would it be to implement?
